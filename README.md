Text analysis with tidytext

The first project includes basic word frequency and tf-idf analysis of selected works of Franz Kafka (The Trial, Metamorphosis) and Fyodor Dostoyevsky (Notes from the Underground, The Idiot, Crime and Punishment).

Most interesting point:
Signature words selected by tf-idf tell a lot about the two authors different styles:

Very interesting how in the longer works of Dostoyevsky (Crime and Punishment, The Idiot) the top representative words are exclusively names of people. In Kafka's case however, both works have only very few personal names much rather objects. This tells a lot about the two authors different styles: Kafka writes from the individual's point of view and puts his characters in a world that is absurd and alienated.
Dostoyevsky on the other hand talks about society narrating his many characters' stories from a distance.
